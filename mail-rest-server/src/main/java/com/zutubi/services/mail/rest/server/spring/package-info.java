/**
 * The contents of this package are based on the Jersey 2 Spring integration
 * prototype https://github.com/marko-asplund/jersey/blob/master/ext/jersey-spring/
 *
 * At the time of this writing, Jersey 2 does not support dependency injection from spring.
 *
 * NOTE: Instantiation of beans occurs outside of the context of an available bean container,
 * so the aspectj @Configurable support is not available.
